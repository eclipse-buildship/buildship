# Buildship sample: Custom Tooling API model

This project shows how can an Eclipse plugin load custom Gradle models via the Buildship's `GradleBuild.withConnection()` API.

The custom model loading implementation is based on https://github.com/bmuschko/tooling-api-custom-model. For the details check the documentation there. 

# Installation and usage
To try the plugin out, clone the repository, and install the plugin from the `org.eclipse.buildship.sample.custommodel.site` directory.
