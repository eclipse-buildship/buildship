# Stories

We capture our ideas for features of Buildship in _stories_. The following stories are currently available:

1. [General](General.md)
1. [Project](Project.md)
1. [Tasks View](TasksView.md)
1. [Dependencies View](DependenciesView.md)
1. [Components View](ComponentsView.md)
1. [Plugins View](PluginsView.md)
1. [Progress View](ProgressView.md)
1. [Run Configuration](RunConfiguration.md)
1. [Settings](Settings.md)
1. [Tooling Commons](ToolingCommons.md)
1. [Tooling API](ToolingAPI.md)
1. [Editor](Editor.md)
1. [Build](Build.md)
1. [Proxy](Proxy.md)

Note that all stories that have been implemented already do have a strike-through title. They will be archived
from the stories documents at some point.
